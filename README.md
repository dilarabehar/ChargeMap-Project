# ChargeMapProject
This project features an interactive map application developed using Django and Google Maps API, designed to display electric vehicle charging stations. The data for these stations is collected through web scraping with Python and Selenium. Additionally, a mobile version of the application has been created using Flutter, enabling users to access and interact with the map on their mobile devices.

### Technologies Used

* Django: For creating the web application backend.
* Google Maps API: To display and manage map data.
* Python (Selenium): For scraping data from web sources.
* Flutter: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
